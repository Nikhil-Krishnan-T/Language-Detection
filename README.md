# Language-Detection

Language detection is a natural language processing task where we need to identify the language of a text or document, by machine learning using Python.

Google Translate is one of the most popular language translators in the world which is used by so many people around the world. 

The most important part of training a language detection model is data. The more data you have about every language, the more accurate your model will perform in real-time.
